# nixos-work

My start with NixOS and understanding the ins and outs. Currently mulling over install options, working from existing configs to understand all the bits.

* `nixos-work/Dorian-DS-NixOS-Configuration` is from [Dorian-DS/NixOS-Configuration](https://github.com/Dorian-DS/NixOS-Configurations)
